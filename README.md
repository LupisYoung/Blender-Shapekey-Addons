# Blender Shapekey Add-Ons
Blender Shapekey Add-Ons is a powerful and user-friendly toolset for managing, organizing, and batch editing shapekeys directly inside Blender. It provides advanced utilities for renaming, grouping, sorting, filtering, and mass-editing shapekeys, making it an essential workflow booster for modelers, riggers, and character artists.

## Features
- **Scrollable Shapekey List:** Quickly navigate even the largest shapekey stacks.
- **Search & Filter:** Instantly locate shapekeys by name or group tag.
- **Selection Tools:** Select all, none, or invert - only affects visible (filtered) keys.
- **Grouping System:** Tag shapekeys with custom group names for easy filtering.
- **Rename Suite:** Add prefixes/suffixes, find & replace, or auto-number shapekeys.
- **Batch Editing:** Adjust slider ranges, reset values, and toggle mute for many keys at once.
- **Safe Ordering:** Move keys around without ever pushing them above the Basis.
- **Collapsible UI Sections:** Clean and organized interface for Groups, Rename, and Batch Edits.
