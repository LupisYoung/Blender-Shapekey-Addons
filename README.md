**Blender Shapekey Add-Ons** is a comprehensive toolset for managing, organizing, and editing shapekeys directly inside Blender.  
It streamlines complex workflows with features for creation, duplication, sorting, grouping, and batch editing, making it an essential workflow booster for modelers, riggers, and character artists.


## Features
### Core Management
- **Create and Duplicate Keys:** Create new shapekeys from scratch, combine selected ones, or duplicate existing keys with prefix and suffix options.  
- **Safe Deletion:** Remove multiple shapekeys at once with confirmation and a selection count.

### Navigation and Selection
- **Scrollable Shapekey List:** Quickly navigate even the largest shapekey stacks.
- **Search & Filter:** Instantly locate shapekeys by name or group tag.
- **Selection Tools:** Select all, none, or invert - only affects visible (filtered) keys.
- **Range Selection:** Hold **Shift** to select between two shapekeys.

### Organization and Editing
- **Grouping System:** Tag shapekeys with custom group names for easy filtering.
- **Rename Suite:** Add prefixes/suffixes, find & replace, or auto-number shapekeys.
- **Batch Editing:** Adjust slider ranges, reset values, and toggle mute for many keys at once.
- **Safe Ordering:** Move keys around without ever pushing them above the Basis.
- **Collapsible UI Sections:** Clean and organized interface for Groups, Rename, and Batch Edits.

### Update System
- **Built-in Update Checker:** Check for new releases from within Blender, either manually or automatically at startup.  
- Displays the current installed version and links directly to the GitHub releases page.
